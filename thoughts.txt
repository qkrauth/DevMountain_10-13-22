There is so much to like about react. I was glad to find out that there is a way to compose good looking interactive websites without writing the same lines of code over and over again. I think I may have watched more of the lecture videos than necessary at the beginning but the way the guy was explaining it made it seem like there is almost no need to create websites using vanilla JS when the react dev community has built many already that we can simply import. The only thing I didnt like was how confused I became in the end once we got to the demo part. Luckily it was all written out for me pretty much cuz I wouldnt have been able to accomplish that yet at my level.

I dont know what pursing React and other JS frameworks looks like but what I do know is that this is going to be my chosen spec, I had already decided on front end dev way before enrolling in a bootcamp and now I am just that much closer
